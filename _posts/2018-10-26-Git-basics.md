I'm collating here the basic mental models that help me reason about Git's behavior. I plan to add more diagrams covering how various commands affect the object store as well as the working, staging and repo area both on the local and the remote repository.

- [Local and remote repositories](#local-and-remote-repositories)
- [`git-reset`](#git-reset)

- [`git tag`](#git-tag)
- [`git rebase`](#git-rebase)

    - [`git rebase` gotchas](#git-rebase-gotchas)
- [References](#references)


## Stages of a file

Post `git init` a file in the directory can be in one of many stages. This is useful to understand how commands such as `git reset`, `git rebase` work. 

Nuanced understanding of how a command affects the stage of a file(s) helps avoid situations where one might lose data by using one of these commands.

## Local and remote repositories

Git is a distributed version control system. Each local repository also contains a copy of all the remote repositories it is linked to. This comes in handy to understand the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`

## `git-reset`

### Difference between `git reset` and `git checkout`

## `git tag` 

Used to highlight certain commits as a milestone in the project.

| Command | Result |
| -- | -- |
| <br> | |
| **Create** | |
| `git tag <tagname>` | Creates a tag at the existing HEAD |
| `git tag <tagname> -m "message" <commit-id>` | Creates a tag at the 'commit-id' with the message |
| `git tag -f <tagname> <commit-id>` | To update the 'tagname' to point at 'commit-id' |
| <br> | |
| **Checkout** | |
| `git checkout <tagname>` | To checkout the specific tag |
| <br> | |
| **List** | |
| `git tag` | List all tags |
| `git tag -n` | List all tags with their messages |
| <br> | |
| **Delete** | |
| `git tag -d <tagname>` | To delete the tag 'tagname' |
| <br> | |
| **Push to remote** | |
| `git push origin <tagname>` | To push the 'tagname' to remote repo |
| `git push --tags` | To push all the tags to remote |

<br>

*`git push` by default does not push tags to the remote repository

## `git rebase`

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit

### Use cases

#### Rebasing to an upstream branch

Allows to modify the base commit of the current branch to the latest commit in the upstream branch giving a linear history of commits during development

#### Modifying commit history

- Edit a commit to add a minor change to an older commit (such as adding a comment)
- Squash commits together to make a meaningful chunk
- Reorder commit listing to preserve order of working on a sub-task
- Removing commits that do not add meaning to the commit history

### `git rebase` gotchas

- If you modify a commit during interactive rebase, that commit and all successive commits will have new SHA-1â€™s

- Avoid rebasing commits that have been pushed to remote repository
