Hello, I'm Divyanshu Singh, a full stack developer ([Github](https://github.com/dsinecos/wiki)) from Delhi, India.

## About this Blog

I find there is an elusive satisfaction to learning how different tools and languages I use work under the hood. This blog is a log of some of my experiments to glean an understanding of what's going on under the hood.

In addition, some of the posts are just notes from the courses I took, or an interesting conference talk I watched, or an article I read.

Every so often, there is something that I can list as a series of steps, such as installing a tool, setting up the development environment, deploying on heroku. I log those in the 'Recipes' section as a reference for later and in the hope it might help someone else too.

## Journey so far

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science in 2012. 

In 2015, I left my job as a Business Analyst at a corporate venture capital to figure out what to do next. I spent the better part of the next year and a half traveling, reading and exploring a few other interests hoping I'd also stumble upon what to do next along the way.

Prompted by a friend who was learning to code, in the beginning of 2017, I decide to learn to code as well. I spent the year, teaching myself through various online resources and building [projects](https://dsinecos.github.io/portfolio/). 

Early 2018, I started work as a Software Engineer at an early stage startup, SegmentOne, which provides a marketing automation platform. Here I helped build and maintain the data pipeline and the backend.

I'm currently working as a freelance developer for Krafteer, a product studio based out of Estonia. I'm building the mobile application for their product, FormHub, which converts spreadsheet based forms into native mobile apps to streamline and ease data collection in organizations.
